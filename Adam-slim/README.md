## Docker
To run project in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) type `docker-compose up` command

DB connection inside Docker:

- hostname: postgres
- user: postgres
- pass: docker
- database name: db

You have to import DB structure using following command:
`docker-compose exec postgres bash /tmp/docker/import.sh`
